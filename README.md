nNet
====
A simple neural net library for golang. This is mainly just for me to explore
and learn about neural networks and GOLANG. As such don't expect anything that
is necessarily efficient.

Features:
===
  - Simple serial execution of neural net.
  - Implementation of Back Propagation Algorithm.
  - Simple API for changing links between nodes.
  
Future Plans:
===
  - Add functions that initialise alternatively structured networks
  - Enhance API for manipulating networks with more complex options.
